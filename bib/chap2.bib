@article{Chen2014,
abstract = {Recent reports show that the incidence of and deaths caused by necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm very-low-birth-weight (PVLBW) infants are on the rise. Unfortunately, NEC often rapidly progresses from early signs of intestinal inflammation to extensive necrosis within a matter of hours, making treatment and secondary prevention extremely difficult to achieve. Primary prevention should thus be the priority. Recent studies provide information that enhances our understanding of the pathophysiology and provides more practical options for the prevention of NEC. The most accepted hypothesis at present is that enteral feeding (providing substrate) in the presence of abnormal intestinal colonization by pathogens provokes an inappropriately heightened inflammatory response in immature intestinal epithelial cells of PVLBW infants. Seventy-four relevant articles were reviewed. Our focus was on the present understanding of the pathophysiology of NEC in the context of developing optimal strategies to prevent NEC in PVLBW infants. Strategies such as antenatal glucocorticoids, postnatal breast milk feeding, and cautious approach to enteral feeding failed to eliminate NEC in PVLBW infants because these strategies did not address the complexity of the pathogenesis. Probiotics seem to be the most significant advance in NEC prevention at present because of the significant range of beneficial effects at various levels of gut function and defense mechanism and the present evidence based on 19 randomized controlled trials.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence has linked the gut microbiome to human obesity. We performed a metagenome-wide association study and serum metabolomics profiling in a cohort of lean and obese, young, Chinese individuals. We identified obesity-associated gut microbial species linked to changes in circulating metabolites. The abundance of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a glutamate-fermenting commensal, was markedly decreased in obese individuals and was inversely correlated with serum glutamate concentration. Consistently, gavage with B. thetaiotaomicron reduced plasma glutamate concentration and alleviated diet-induced body-weight gain and adiposity in mice. Furthermore, weight-loss intervention by bariatric surgery partially reversed obesity-associated microbial and metabolic alterations in obese individuals, including the decreased abundance of B. thetaiotaomicron and the elevated serum glutamate concentration. Our findings identify previously unknown links between intestinal microbiota alterations, circulating amino acids and obesity, suggesting that it may be possible to intervene in obesity by targeting the gut microbiota.},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to evaluate the relative contribution of ischemia, bacteria, and luminal substrate, the pathogenetic components of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), to the development of intestinal necrosis. Sprague-Dawley rats, either germ-free (No.=25) or conventionally colonized (No.=20) underwent laparotomy. Isolated ileal segments were created, two per rat. Ischemia was produced in one segment by application of a microaneurysm clip; the other segment served as a control. Segments were injected with 1 mL of either normal saline, dilute Similac formula, or standard formula. Groups were as follows: Group 1 (germ-free), received saline; Group II (germ-free), dilute formula; Group III (germ-free), standard formula; Group IV (conventional), saline; Group V (conventional), dilute formula; Group VI (conventional), standard formula. At 48 hours, the rats were evaluated for survival, gross bowel integrity, histologic severity of necrosis (graded 0 to 4+), and bacteriology. Gross analysis of bowel integrity showed no lesions in the ischemic segments of the germ-free rats (Groups I, II, and III) and necrosis in 75{\%} of conventionally colonized animals (Groups IV, V, and VI; P{\textless}0.001). Microscopic necrosis was more common (P{\textless}0.001) in ischemic segments of conventional rats than in ischemic segments of germ-free rats. There was no difference in necrosis attributable to ischemic time or to the presence of either standard or dilute formula. Of the three pathogenetic evaluated, the presence of bacteria was most crucial to the development of bowel necrosis in this model. Improved treatment and prevention of NEC may depend upon suppression and/or modification of the gut flora. {\textcopyright} 1986 Grune {\&} Stratton, Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Patients with IBD display substantial heterogeneity in clinical characteristics. We hypothesise that individual differences in the complex interaction of the host genome and the gut microbiota can explain the onset and the heterogeneous presentation of IBD. Therefore, we performed a case-control analysis of the gut microbiota, the host genome and the clinical phenotypes of IBD. DESIGN Stool samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data were collected from 313 patients with IBD and 582 truly healthy controls, selected from a population cohort. The gut microbiota composition was assessed by tag-sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. All participants were genotyped. We composed genetic risk scores from 11 functional genetic variants proven to be associated with IBD in genes that are directly involved in the bacterial handling in the gut: NOD2, CARD9, ATG16L1, IRGM and FUT2. RESULTS Strikingly, we observed significant alterations of the gut microbiota of healthy individuals with a high genetic risk for IBD: the IBD genetic risk score was significantly associated with a decrease in the genus Roseburia in healthy controls (false discovery rate 0.017). Moreover, disease location was a major determinant of the gut microbiota: the gut microbiota of patients with colonic Crohn's disease (CD) is different from that of patients with ileal CD, with a decrease in alpha diversity associated to ileal disease (p=3.28×10-13). CONCLUSIONS We show for the first time that genetic risk variants associated with IBD influence the gut microbiota in healthy individuals. Roseburia spp are acetate-to-butyrate converters, and a decrease has already been observed in patients with IBD.},

How the immune system perceives commensals in the context of mucosal infection is unclear. Here, we show that during a gastrointestinal infection, tolerance to commensals is lost, and microbiota-specific T cells are activated and differentiate to inflammatory effector cells. Furthermore, these T cells go on to form memory cells that are phenotypically and functionally consistent with pathogen-specific T cells. Our results suggest that during a gastrointestinal infection, the immune response to commensals parallels the immune response against pathogenic microbes and that adaptive responses against commensals are an integral component of mucosal immunity.},

Intestinal bacteria have an important function; however no causative pathogen has been identified. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are differences in microbial patterns that may be critical to the development of this disease. Fecal samples from 20 preterm infants, 10 with NEC and 10 matched controls (including 4 twin pairs) were obtained from patients in a single site level III neonatal intensive care unit. Bacterial DNA from individual fecal samples was PCR-amplified and subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and library sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize diversity and structure of the enteric microbiota. The distribution of samples from NEC patients distinctly clustered separately from controls. Intestinal bacterial colonization in all preterm infants was notable for low diversity. Patients with NEC had even less diversity, an increase in abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, a decrease in other bacteria species, and had received a higher mean number of previous days of antibiotics. Our results suggest that NEC is associated with severe lack of microbiota diversity that may accentuate the impact of single dominant microorganisms favored by empiric and widespread use of antibiotics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Late onset sepsis (LOS) in preterm infants is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. While studies have implicated gut bacteria in the aetiology of the disease, functional analysis and mechanistic insights are generally lacking. We performed temporal bacterial (n = 613) and metabolomic (n = 63) profiling on extensively sampled stool from 7 infants with LOS and 28 matched healthy (no LOS or NEC) controls. RESULTS The bacteria isolated in diagnostic blood culture usually corresponded to the dominant bacterial genera in the gut microbiome. Longitudinal changes were monitored based on preterm gut community types (PGCTs), where control infants had an increased number of PGCTs compared to LOS infants (P = 0.011). PGCT 6, characterised by Bifidobacteria dominance, was only present in control infants. Metabolite profiles differed between LOS and control infants at diagnosis and 7 days later, but not 7 days prior to diagnosis. Bifidobacteria was positively correlated with control metabolites, including raffinose, sucrose, and acetic acid. CONCLUSIONS Using multi-omic analysis, we show that the gut microbiome is involved in the pathogenesis of LOS. While the causative agent of LOS varies, it is usually abundant in the gut. Bifidobacteria dominance was associated with control infants, and the presence of this organism may directly protect, or act as a marker for protection, against gut epithelial translocation. While the metabolomic data is preliminary, the findings support that gut development and protection in preterm infants is associated with increased in prebiotic oligosaccharides (e.g. raffinose) and the growth of beneficial bacteria (e.g. Bifidobacterium).},

Endotoxin given intraperitoneally promoted bacterial translocation in a dose-dependent fashion from the gut to the mesenteric lymph node (MLN). The incidence of bacterial translocation to the MLN was similar whether the endotoxin was administered intramuscularly or intraperitoneally, although the number of bacteria colonizing the MLN was greater with intraperitoneal endotoxin. The incidence and magnitude of endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation were similar between CD-1 and C3H/HeJ (endotoxin-resistant) mice, indicating that bacterial translocation is not prevented by genetic resistance to endotoxin. Thus, it appears that the gut may serve as a reservoir for bacteria causing systemic infections during endotoxemia.},

Suspected NEC can be indistinguishable from sepsis, and in established cases an infant may die within hours of diagnosis. Present treatment is supportive. A means of presymptomatic diagnosis is urgently needed. We aimed to identify microbial signatures in the gastrointestinal microbiota preceding NEC diagnosis in premature infants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Fecal samples and clinical data were collected from a 2-year cohort of 369 premature neonates. Next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene regions was used to characterize the microbiota of prediagnosis fecal samples from 12 neonates with NEC, 8 with suspected NEC, and 44 controls. Logistic regression was used to determine clinical characteristics and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) discriminating cases from controls. Samples were cultured and isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. Clostridial isolates were typed and toxin genes detected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A clostridial OTU was overabundant in prediagnosis samples from infants with established NEC (P = .006). Culture confirmed the presence of Clostridium perfringens type A. Fluorescent amplified fragment-length polymorphism typing established that no isolates were identical. Prediagnosis samples from NEC infants not carrying profuse C. perfringens revealed an overabundance of a Klebsiella OTU (P = .049). Prolonged continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy with supplemental oxygen was also associated with increased NEC risk.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Two fecal microbiota signatures (Clostridium and Klebsiella OTUs) and need for prolonged CPAP oxygen signal increased risk of NEC in presymptomatic infants.

abstract = {Metabolomics studies hold promise for the discovery of pathways linked to disease processes. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. Here we used a metabolomics approach to generate unbiased small-molecule metabolic profiles in plasma that predict risk for CVD. Three metabolites of the dietary lipid phosphatidylcholine--choline, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and betaine--were identified and then shown to predict risk for CVD in an independent large clinical cohort. Dietary supplementation of mice with choline, TMAO or betaine promoted upregulation of multiple macrophage scavenger receptors linked to atherosclerosis, and supplementation with choline or TMAO promoted atherosclerosis. Studies using germ-free mice confirmed a critical role for dietary choline and gut flora in TMAO production, augmented macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation. Suppression of intestinal microflora in atherosclerosis-prone mice inhibited dietary-choline-enhanced atherosclerosis. Genetic variations controlling expression of flavin monooxygenases, an enzymatic source of TMAO, segregated with atherosclerosis in hyperlipidaemic mice. Discovery of a relationship between gut-flora-dependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine and CVD pathogenesis provides opportunities for the development of new diagnostic tests and therapeutic approaches for atherosclerotic heart disease.},

Microbiota development, a cascade of initial colonization events leading to the establishment of a diverse commensal microbiota, can now be studied in preterm infants using powerful molecular tools. Starting with the first stool and continuing until discharge, weekly stool specimens were collected prospectively from infants with gestational ages ≤32 completed weeks or birth weights≤1250 g. High throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was used to compare the diversity of microbiota and the prevalence of specific bacterial signatures in nine NEC infants and in nine matched controls. After removal of short and low quality reads we retained a total of 110,021 sequences. Microbiota composition differed in the matched samples collected 1 week but not {\textless}72 hours prior to NEC diagnosis. We detected a bloom (34{\%} increase) of Proteobacteria and a decrease (32{\%}) in Firmicutes in NEC cases between the 1 week and {\textless}72 hour samples. No significant change was identified in the controls. At both time points, molecular signatures were identified that were increased in NEC cases. One of the bacterial signatures detected more frequently in NEC cases (p{\textless}0.01) matched closest to $\gamma$-Proteobacteria. Although this sequence grouped to the well-studied Enterobacteriaceae family, it did not match any sequence in Genbank by more than 97{\%}. Our observations suggest that abnormal patterns of microbiota and potentially a novel pathogen contribute to the etiology of NEC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:  Medical care for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and their mothers has changed dramatically during the 1990s, yet it is unclear how these changes have affected mortality and morbidity. OBJECTIVE:  We used the Vermont Oxford Network Database to identify trends in clinical practice and patient outcomes for VLBW infants born from 1991 to 1999. METHODS:  Logistic regression was used to evaluate temporal trends in practices and outcomes while adjusting for patient characteristics and accounting for clustering of cases within hospitals. RESULTS:  There were 118 448 infants 501 to 1500 g from 362 neonatal intensive care units enrolled in the Network Database from 1991 to 1999. Prenatal care, cesarean section, multiple births, antenatal steroids, and 1-minute Apgar scores increased during this period, as did the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure, high-frequency ventilation, surfactant, and postnatal steroids. The proportion of white infants decreased; the proportions of Hispanic infants and those of other races increased. The crude and adjusted rates of mortality, pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and severe IVH declined from 1991 to 1995, whereas from 1995 to 1999, the rates of mortality, IVH, and severe IVH did not change significantly, and pneumothorax increased. CONCLUSIONS:  There have been major changes in both obstetric and neonatal care during the 1990s. These changes were associated with decreases in mortality and morbidity for VLBW infants during the first half of the decade. However, since 1995, no additional improvements in mortality or morbidity have been seen, ending a decades-long trend of improving outcomes for these infants},

abstract = {Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory disease of the newborn bowel, primarily affecting premature infants. Early intestinal colonization has been implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC. The objective of this prospective case-control study was to evaluate differences in the intestinal microbiota between infants who developed NEC and unaffected controls prior to disease onset. We conducted longitudinal analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of 312 samples obtained from 12 NEC cases and 26 age-matched controls with a median frequency of 7 samples per subject and median sampling interval of 3 days. We found that the microbiome undergoes dynamic development during the first two months of life with day of life being the major factor contributing to the colonization process. Depending on when the infant was diagnosed with NEC (i.e. early vs. late onset), the pattern of microbial progression was different for cases and controls. The difference in the microbiota was most overt in early onset NEC cases and controls. In proximity to NEC onset, the abundances of Clostridium sensu stricto from Clostridia class were significantly higher in early onset NEC subjects comparing to controls. In late onset NEC, Escherichia/Shigella among Gammaproteobacteria, showed an increasing pattern prior to disease onset, and was significantly higher in cases than controls six days before NEC onset. Cronobacter from Gammaproteobacteria was also significantly higher in late onset NEC cases than controls 1-3 days prior to NEC onset. Thus, the specific infectious agent associated with NEC may vary by the age of infant at disease onset. We found that intravenously administered antibiotics may have an impact on the microbial diversity present in fecal material. Longitudinal analysis at multiple time points was an important strategy utilized in this study, allowing us to appreciate the dynamics of the premature infant intestinal microbiome while approaching NEC at various points.},

It has long been suspected that intestinal microbes contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC, but the details of this relationship remain poorly understood. Recent advances in molecular biology and enteric microbiology have improved our ability to characterize intestinal microbes from infants with NEC and from healthy unaffected newborns. The lack of diversity within the neonatal intestine makes it possible to study gut microbial communities at a high level of resolution not currently possible in corresponding studies of the adult intestinal tract. Here, we summarize clinical and laboratory evidence that supports the hypothesis that NEC is a microbe-mediated disorder. In addition, we detail recent technologic advances that may be harnessed to perform high-throughput, comprehensive studies of the gut microbes of very low birth weight infants. Methods for characterizing microbial genotype are discussed, as are methods of identifying patterns of gene expression, protein expression, and metabolite production. Application of these technologies to biological samples from affected and unaffected newborns may lead to advances in the care of infants who are at risk for the unabated problem of NEC.},

Breakdown of intestinal barrier function is known to play a role in many diseases such as infectious enteritis, idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, and neonatal inflammatory bowel diseases. Recently, increasing research has demonstrated the importance of understanding how intestinal epithelial barrier function develops in the premature neonate in order to develop strategies to promote its maturation. Optimizing intestinal barrier function is thought to be key to preventing neonatal inflammatory bowel diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis. In this review, we will first summarize the key components of the intestinal epithelial barrier, what is known about its development, and how this may explain NEC pathogenesis. Finally, we will review what therapeutic strategies may be used to promote optimal development of neonatal intestinal barrier function in order to reduce the incidence and severity of NEC.},

abstract = {In the weeks after birth, the gut acquires a nascent microbiome, and starts its transition to bacterial population equilibrium. This early-in-life microbial population quite likely influences later-in-life host biology. However, we know little about the governance of community development: does the gut serve as a passive incubator where the first organisms randomly encountered gain entry and predominate, or is there an orderly progression of members joining the community of bacteria? We used fine interval enumeration of microbes in stools from multiple subjects to answer this question. We demonstrate via 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing of 922 specimens from 58 subjects that the gut microbiota of premature infants residing in a tightly controlled microbial environment progresses through a choreographed succession of bacterial classes from Bacilli to Gammaproteobacteria to Clostridia, interrupted by abrupt population changes. As infants approach 33-36 wk postconceptional age (corresponding to the third to the twelfth weeks of life depending on gestational age at birth), the gut is well colonized by anaerobes. Antibiotics, vaginal vs. Caesarian birth, diet, and age of the infants when sampled influence the pace, but not the sequence, of progression. Our results suggest that in infants in a microbiologically constrained ecosphere of a neonatal intensive care unit, gut bacterial communities have an overall nonrandom assembly that is punctuated by microbial population abruptions. The possibility that the pace of this assembly depends more on host biology (chiefly gestational age at birth) than identifiable exogenous factors warrants further consideration.},

abstract = {The intestinal microflora is a positive health asset that crucially influences the normal structural and functional development of the mucosal immune system. Mucosal immune responses to resident intestinal microflora require precise control and an immunosensory capacity for distinguishing commensal from pathogenic bacteria. In genetically susceptible individuals, some components of the flora can become a liability and contribute to the pathogenesis of various intestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases. It follows that manipulation of the flora to enhance the beneficial components represents a promising therapeutic strategy. The flora has a collective metabolic activity equal to a virtual organ within an organ, and the mechanisms underlying the conditioning influence of the bacteria on mucosal homeostasis and immune responses are beginning to be unravelled. An improved understanding of this hidden organ will reveal secrets that are relevant to human health and to several infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic disease processes.},

From young infants to elderly people, from primitive tribes to modern societies, accumulating evidence has suggested the association of critical physiological roles of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of a variety of human metabolic, immunological and neurological diseases. Importantly, it appears that the relationship between the gut microbiota and disease is bidirectional, instead of causal or consequential.

We sought to determine the impact of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis) in the established rat model of NEC.Methods:Rat pups delivered 1 d prior to term gestation were assigned to one of three groups: dam fed (DF), formula fed (FF), or fed with formula supplemented with 5 × 10(6) CFU B. infantis per day (FF+Binf). Experimental pups were exposed to hypoxia and cold stress. Ileal tissue was examined for pathology and expression of inflammatory mediators, antimicrobial peptides, and goblet-cell products. Ceca were assessed for bacterial composition by analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence.Results:Administration of B. infantis significantly reduced the incidence of NEC, decreased expression of Il6, Cxcl1, Tnfa, Il23, and iNOS, and decreased expression of the antimicrobial peptides Reg3b and Reg3g. There was significant microbial heterogeneity both within groups and between experiments. The cecal microbiota was not significantly different between the FF and FF+Binf groups. Bifidobacteria were not detected in the cecum in significant numbers.Conclusion:In the rat model, the inflammation associated with NEC was attenuated by administration of probiotic B. infantis.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut under severe insult is considered to have an important role in promoting infection and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome from the viewpoint of altered intestinal epithelium, immune system and commensal bacteria. There are few reports, however, about the relationship between gut flora and septic complications. METHODS: We analyzed gut flora in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and evaluated key bacteria and their cutoff values for infectious complications and mortality by using classification and regression trees (CART). Eighty-one SIRS patients with a serum C-reactive protein level higher than 10 mg/dL treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) for more than 2 days were included for the study. We quantitatively evaluated nine types of bacteria in fecal samples by plate or tube technique. Two hundred seventy-one samples were analyzed using CART and logistic regression. RESULTS: The dominant factors for complication of enteritis were the minimum number of total obligate anaerobes and the maximum number of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus. The dominant factors for complication of bacteremia were the minimum numbers of total obligate anaerobes and total facultative anaerobes. The dominant factors for mortality were the numbers of total obligate anaerobes and total facultative anaerobes and age. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in total obligate anaerobes and an increase in pathogenic bacteria in the gut are associated with septic complications and mortality in patients with SIRS. The altered gut flora may be a potential prognostic marker in SIRS patients.},

abstract = {Background: The pathophysiology of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains poorly understood.Objective: We assessed the relation between feeding strategies, intestinal microbiota composition, and the development of NEC.Design: We performed a prospective nationwide population-based study, EPIPAGE 2 (Etude Epidemiologique sur les Petits Ages Gestationnels), including preterm infants born at {\textless}32 wk of gestation in France in 2011. From individual characteristics observed during the first week of life, we calculated a propensity score for the risk of NEC (Bell's stage 2 or 3) after day 7 of life. We analyzed the relation between neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) strategies concerning the rate of progression of enteral feeding, the direct-breastfeeding policy, and the onset of NEC using general linear mixed models to account for clustering by the NICU. An ancillary propensity-matched case-control study, EPIFLORE (Etude Epidemiologique de la flore), in 20 of the 64 NICUs, analyzed the intestinal microbiota by culture and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.Results: Among the 3161 enrolled preterm infants, 106 (3.4{\%}; 95{\%} CI: 2.8{\%}, 4.0{\%}) developed NEC. Individual characteristics were significantly associated with NEC. Slower and intermediate rates of progression of enteral feeding strategies were associated with a higher risk of NEC, with an adjusted OR of 2.3 (95{\%} CI: 1.2, 4.5; P = 0.01) and 2.0 (95{\%} CI: 1.1, 3.5; P = 0.02), respectively. Less favorable and intermediate direct-breastfeeding policies were associated with higher NEC risk as well, with an adjusted OR of 2.5 (95{\%} CI: 1.1, 5.8; P = 0.03) and 2.3 (95{\%} CI: 1.1, 4.8; P = 0.02), respectively. Microbiota analysis performed in 16 cases and 78 controls showed an association between Clostridium neonatale and Staphylococcus aureus with NEC (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002).Conclusions: A slow rate of progression of enteral feeding and a less favorable direct-breastfeeding policy are associated with an increased risk of developing NEC. For a given level of risk assessed by propensity score, colonization by C. neonatale and/or S. aureus is significantly associated with NEC. This trial (EPIFLORE study) was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01127698.},

abstract = {Background: Gut bacteria might predispose to or protect from necrotising enterocolitis, a severe illness linked to prematurity. In this observational prospective study we aimed to assess whether one or more bacterial taxa in the gut differ between infants who subsequently develop necrotising enterocolitis (cases) and those who do not (controls). Methods: We enrolled very low birthweight (1500 g and lower) infants in the primary cohort (St Louis Children's Hospital) between July 7, 2009, and Sept 16, 2013, and in the secondary cohorts (Kosair Children's Hospital and Children's Hospital at Oklahoma University) between Sept 12, 2011 and May 25, 2013. We prospectively collected and then froze stool samples for all infants. Cases were defined as infants whose clinical courses were consistent with necrotising enterocolitis and whose radiographs fulfilled criteria for Bell's stage 2 or 3 necrotising enterocolitis. Control infants (one to four per case; not fixed ratios) with similar gestational ages, birthweight, and birth dates were selected from the population after cases were identified. Using primers specific for bacterial 16S rRNA genes, we amplified and then pyrosequenced faecal DNA from stool samples. With use of Dirichlet multinomial analysis and mixed models to account for repeated measures, we identified host factors, including development of necrotising enterocolitis, associated with gut bacterial populations. Findings: We studied 2492 stool samples from 122 infants in the primary cohort, of whom 28 developed necrotising enterocolitis; 94 infants were used as controls. The microbial community structure in case stools differed significantly from those in control stools. These differences emerged only after the first month of age. In mixed models, the time-by-necrotising-enterocolitis interaction was positively associated with Gammaproteobacteria (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0010) and negatively associated with strictly anaerobic bacteria, especially Negativicutes (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0019). We studied 1094 stool samples from 44 infants in the secondary cohorts. 18 infants developed necrotising enterocolitis (cases) and 26 were controls. After combining data from all cohorts (166 infants, 3586 stools, 46 cases of necrotising enterocolitis), there were increased proportions of Gammaproteobacteria (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0011) and lower proportions of both Negativicutes (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0013) and the combined Clostridia-Negativicutes class (p=0{\textperiodcentered}0051) in infants who went on to develop necrotising enterocolitis compared with controls. These associations were strongest in both the primary cohort and the overall cohort for infants born at less than 27 weeks' gestation. Interpretation: A relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria (ie, Gram-negative facultative bacilli) and relative paucity of strict anaerobic bacteria (especially Negativicutes) precede necrotising enterocolitis in very low birthweight infants. These data offer candidate targets for interventions to prevent necrotising enterocolitis, at least among infants born at less than 27 weeks' gestation.

abstract = {Intestinal luminal microbiota likely contribute to the etiology of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a common disease in preterm infants. Microbiota development, a cascade of initial colonization events leading to the establishment of a diverse commensal microbiota, can now be studied in preterm infants using powerful molecular tools. Starting with the first stool and continuing until discharge, weekly stool specimens were collected prospectively from infants with gestational ages ≤32 completed weeks or birth weights≤1250 g. High throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was used to compare the diversity of microbiota and the prevalence of specific bacterial signatures in nine NEC infants and in nine matched controls. After removal of short and low quality reads we retained a total of 110,021 sequences. Microbiota composition differed in the matched samples collected 1 week but not {\textless}72 hours prior to NEC diagnosis. We detected a bloom (34{\%} increase) of Proteobacteria and a decrease (32{\%}) in Firmicutes in NEC cases between the 1 week and {\textless}72 hour samples. No significant change was identified in the controls. At both time points, molecular signatures were identified that were increased in NEC cases. One of the bacterial signatures detected more frequently in NEC cases (p{\textless}0.01) matched closest to $\gamma$-Proteobacteria. Although this sequence grouped to the well-studied Enterobacteriaceae family, it did not match any sequence in Genbank by more than 97{\%}. Our observations suggest that abnormal patterns of microbiota and potentially a novel pathogen contribute to the etiology of NEC.},

abstract = {A method of clinical staging for infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is proposed. On the basis of assigned stage at the time of diagnosis, 48 infants were treated with graded intervention. For Stage I infants, vigorous diagnostic and supportive measures are appropriate. Stage II infants are treated medically, including parenteral and gavage aminoglycoside antibiotic, and Stage III patients require operation. All Stage I patients survived, and 32 of 38 Stage II and III patients (85{\%}) survived the acute episode of NEC. Bacteriologic evaluation of the gastrointestinal microflora in these neonates has revealed a wide range of enteric organisms including anaerobes. Enteric organisms were cultured from the blood of four infants dying of NEC. Sequential cultures of enteric organisms reveal an alteration of flora during gavage antibiotic therapy. These studies support the use of combination antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of infants with NEC.},
