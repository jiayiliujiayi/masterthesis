abstract = {Sperm DNA damage has a significant impact on reproductive outcomes. In recent years, the search for optimal molecular markers for the evaluation of semen quality has resulted in the increased focus on sperm nuclear DNA assessment. The primary aim of this article was to review and summarize the effects of freezing-thawing procedure on nuclear DNA integrity of boar spermatozoa. Using different sperm DNA integrity assays, it has been confirmed that the sperm DNA undergoes structural changes during the freezing-thawing process. Evidence has been shown that a significant proportion of frozen-thawed spermatozoa with compromised chromatin integrity was highly susceptible to DNA fragmentation. Moreover, the possible mechanisms responsible for post-thaw sperm DNA damage could be because of cryo-induced oxidative stress and, to a lesser extent, to the activation of an apoptotic-like phenomenon. This review also highlights the ongoing effort employed to develop optimal strategies to reduce sperm DNA damage following freezing-thawing of boar semen.},

abstract = {The principal resolution limitation in electron cryomicroscopy of frozen-hydrated biological samples is radiation damage. It has long been hoped that cooling such samples to just a few kelvins with liquid helium would slow this damage and allow statistically better-defined images to be recorded. A new "G2 Polara" microscope from FEI Company was used to image various biological samples cooled by either liquid nitrogen or liquid helium to ???82 or ???12 K, respectively, and the results were compared with particular interest in the doses (10-200 e-/??2) and resolutions (3-8 nm) typical for electron cryotomography. Simple dose series revealed a gradual loss of contrast at ???12 K through the first several tens of e -/??2, after which small bubbles appeared. Single particle reconstructions from each image in a dose series showed no difference in the preservation of medium-resolution (3-5 nm) structural detail at the two temperatures. Tomographic reconstructions produced with total doses between 10 and 350 e-/??2 showed better results at ???82 K than ???12 K for every dose tested. Thus disappointingly, cooling with liquid helium is actually disadvantageous for cryotomography. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Identifying intestinal microbiota is arguably an important task that is performed to determine the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD); thus, it is crucial to collect and analyze intestinally-associated microbiota. Analyzing a single niche to categorize individuals does not enable researchers to comprehensively study the spatial variations of the microbiota. Therefore, characterizing the spatial community structures of the inflammatory bowel disease microbiome is critical for advancing our understanding of the inflammatory landscape of IBD. However, at present there is no universally accepted consensus regarding the use of specific sampling strategies in different biogeographic locations. In this review, we discuss the spatial distribution when screening sample collections in IBD microbiota research. Here, we propose a novel model, a three-dimensional spatial community structure, which encompasses the x-, y-, and z-axis distributions; it can be used in some sampling sites, such as feces, colonoscopic biopsy, the mucus gel layer, and oral cavity. On the basis of this spatial model, this article also summarizes various sampling and processing strategies prior to and after DNA extraction and recommends guidelines for practical application in future research.},

abstract = {The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that has a symbiotic relationship with its host. An association between the gut microbiota and disease was first postulated in the early 20(th) century. However, until the 1990s, knowledge of the gut microbiota was limited because bacteriological culture was the only technique available to characterize its composition. Only a fraction (estimated at {\textless}30{\%}) of the gut microbiota has been cultured to date. Since the 1990s, advances in culture-independent techniques have spearheaded our knowledge of the complexity of this ecosystem. These techniques have elucidated the microbial diversity of the gut microbiota and have shown that alterations in the gut microbiota composition and function are associated with certain disease states, such as IBD and obesity. These new techniques are fast, facilitate high throughput, identify organisms that are uncultured to date and enable enumeration of organisms present in the gut microbiota. This Review discusses the techniques that can used to characterize the gut microbiota, when they can be applied to human studies and their relative advantages and limitations.},

abstract = {Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a life-threatening complication of Hirsch-sprung's disease (HD). Although the pathological mechanisms are still unclear, studies have shown that HAEC has a close relationship with the disturbance of intestinal microbiota. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of the intestinal microbiome of HD patients with or without enterocolitis. During routine or emergency surgery, we collected 35 intestinal con-tent samples from five patients with HAEC and eight HD patients, including three HD patients with a history of enterocolitis who were in a HAEC remission (HAEC-R) phase. Using Illu-mina-MiSeq high-throughput sequencing, we sequenced the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined by 97{\%} sequence similarity. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of weighted UniFrac distances was performed to evalu-ate the diversity of each intestinal microbiome sample. The microbiota differed significantly between the HD patients (characterized by the prevalence of Bacteroidetes) and HAEC patients (characterized by the prevalence of Proteobacteria), while the microbiota of the HAEC-R patients was more similar to that of the HAEC patients. We also observed that the specimens from different intestinal sites of each HD patient differed significantly, while the specimens from different intestinal sites of each HAEC and HAEC-R patient were more simi-lar. In conclusion, the microbiome pattern of the HAEC-R patients was more similar to that of the HAEC patients than to that of the HD patients. The HD patients had a relatively distinct, more stable community than the HAEC and HAEC-R patients, suggesting that enterocolitis may either be caused by or result in a disruption of the patient's uniquely adapted intestinal flora. The intestinal microbiota associated with enterocolitis may persist following symptom resolution and can be implicated in the symptom recurrence.},

An astonishing complexity of genome architecture has been revealed, bringing these sequencing technologies to even greater advancements. Some approaches maximize the number of bases sequenced in the least amount of time, generating a wealth of data that can be used to understand increasingly complex phenotypes. Alternatively, other approaches now aim to sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential for resolving structurally complex regions. These and other strategies are providing researchers and clinicians a variety of tools to probe genomes in greater depth, leading to an enhanced understanding of how genome sequence variants underlie phenotype and disease.},

abstract = {Intestinal luminal microbiota likely contribute to the etiology of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a common disease in preterm infants. Microbiota development, a cascade of initial colonization events leading to the establishment of a diverse commensal microbiota, can now be studied in preterm infants using powerful molecular tools. Starting with the first stool and continuing until discharge, weekly stool specimens were collected prospectively from infants with gestational ages ≤32 completed weeks or birth weights≤1250 g. High throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was used to compare the diversity of microbiota and the prevalence of specific bacterial signatures in nine NEC infants and in nine matched controls. After removal of short and low quality reads we retained a total of 110,021 sequences. Microbiota composition differed in the matched samples collected 1 week but not {\textless}72 hours prior to NEC diagnosis. We detected a bloom (34{\%} increase) of Proteobacteria and a decrease (32{\%}) in Firmicutes in NEC cases between the 1 week and {\textless}72 hour samples. No significant change was identified in the controls. At both time points, molecular signatures were identified that were increased in NEC cases. One of the bacterial signatures detected more frequently in NEC cases (p{\textless}0.01) matched closest to $\gamma$-Proteobacteria. Although this sequence grouped to the well-studied Enterobacteriaceae family, it did not match any sequence in Genbank by more than 97{\%}. Our observations suggest that abnormal patterns of microbiota and potentially a novel pathogen contribute to the etiology of NEC.},

abstract = {Sequencing-based analysis has become a well-established approach to deciphering the composition of the gut microbiota. However, due to the complexity of accessing sufficient material from colonoscopic biopsy samples, most studies have focused on faecal microbiota analysis, even though it is recognised that differences exist between the microbial composition of colonic biopsies and faecal samples. We determined the suitability of colonic lavage samples to see if it had comparable microbial diversity composition to colonic biopsies as they are without the limitations associated with sample size. We collected paired colonic biopsies and lavage samples from subjects who were attending for colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy. Next-generation sequencing and qPCR validation were performed with multiple bioinformatics analyses to determine the composition and predict function of the microbiota. Colonic lavage samples contained significantly higher numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) compared to corresponding biopsy samples, however, diversity and evenness between lavage and biopsy samples were similar. The differences seen were driven by the presence of 12 OTUs which were in higher relative abundance in biopsies and were either not present or in low relative abundance in lavage samples, whilst a further 3 OTUs were present in higher amounts in the lavage samples compared to biopsy samples. However, predicted functional community profiling based on 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) data indicated minimal differences between sample types. We propose that colonic lavage samples provide a relatively accurate representation of biopsy microbiota composition and should be considered where biopsy size is an issue.},
